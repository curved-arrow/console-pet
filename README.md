### Introduction
 - This is a console version of a GUI application that is planned to display an image on screen, accept clicks, store data into a local database, fetch date and time, and "interact" with the user.
 - This is meant to mimic an actual pet who may sit on your desk all day wondering why you're typing on your keyboard all day and night.
 - This console version is proof of concept that provides working logic that can be implemented into a GUI app.

### User Choices

 - The user can feed, exercise, and pet their virtual pet.

### How to interact
